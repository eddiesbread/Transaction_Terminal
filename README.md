#  Transaction Terminal

**Transaction Terminal** is a hybrid CLI + web-based finance manager built in Python. It processes and analyzes transaction records stored in an SQLite database and CSV files. The terminal interface allows quick data entry and analytics, while the Django dashboard provides a clean web-based visualization of your finances.
